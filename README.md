# KeySphere - Real Estate Management Application

KeySphere is a powerful web application designed to manage real estate properties efficiently. It allows users to browse available properties, get details, and facilitates easy interactions for both buyers and sellers. The backend of this application is built with **Laravel**, providing a solid and flexible foundation for modern web applications.

## Features

- **Real Estate Listings**: View and manage properties available for rent and sale.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration powered by **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Admin Dashboard**: Allows admin to manage properties, users, and view site activity.
- **API Documentation**: API endpoints are fully documented with **Swagger** for easy integration and development.

## About Laravel

KeySphere is built using **Laravel**, a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
